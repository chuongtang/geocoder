# Testing sandbox for Google Map API

### In this project, I use google-map-react package to help me integrate location into my React app. This package is a component written over a small set of the Google Maps API, and it allows any React component to be rendered on the Google Map.

### Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers or position the map
